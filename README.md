# Wine Quality Analysis ReadMe

This repository provides an in-depth analysis of wine quality based on various physicochemical attributes. The analysis focuses on understanding the features that influence wine quality and visualizing key insights using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between the physicochemical properties of wines and their quality scores. Using statistical methods and data visualization, we aim to identify significant features that affect wine quality and build predictive models.

## Features

The dataset includes the following features:

1. **Fixed Acidity**: Concentration of non-volatile acids in wine.
2. **Volatile Acidity**: Concentration of volatile acids, which impact aroma.
3. **Citric Acid**: A minor acid in wines that can add freshness.
4. **Residual Sugar**: Sugar left after fermentation, contributing to sweetness.
5. **Chlorides**: Salt content in wine.
6. **Free Sulfur Dioxide**: SO2 not bound to other molecules; acts as an antioxidant.
7. **Total Sulfur Dioxide**: Total SO2 content, including both bound and free forms.
8. **Density**: Density of wine, influenced by sugar and alcohol content.
9. **pH**: Measure of acidity or alkalinity.
10. **Sulphates**: Adds to wineâ€™s sulfur dioxide levels; enhances flavor.
11. **Alcohol**: Alcohol content in wine.
12. **Quality**: Score assigned to wine quality by wine tasters (range: 0-10).
